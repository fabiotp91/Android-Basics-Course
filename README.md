## Android Basics Course
I will keep all the projects here for easy access to other students so that they can learn new things with my projects, get feedback from other people about my projects and even to improve them.

## Installation
Each folder has a project that was developed for the Android Basics Course, below I will show an example of each one so that its easy to know which project you may want to clone.
