## Android Basics Course

I will keep all the projects here for easy access to other students so that they can learn new things with my projects, get feedback from other people about my projects and even to improve them.

## Installation

Each folder has a project that was developed for the Android Basics Course, below I will show an example of each one so that its easy to know which project you may want to clone.

> **Note:**
>
> - If you just want to use a certain project just clone the correspondent folder
> - There's no need to clone the whole repository unless you want all the projects

## Projects
The projects show are in alphabetical order so that corresponds to the folder order in the repository.

## **Color Blindness**

This was the app that I created for Project 3 - The Quiz App.
I decided to choose the Color Blindness Test, because I wanted to create an app that could be "useful",
and not just another quiz app about something I like.

This project is also translated to Portuguese.

## **Happy Birthday**

My Happy Birthday Card is different because I wanted to create something that I could use if I needed,
so I created a Business Card App, I intend on improving it so that it can be used as a portfolio for my work.
